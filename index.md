I’m a software engineer and startup veteran, focused on creating products that users love.

### Aerospace (Stealth) / Founding Software Engineer  (Q3 2022)
I successfully architected and implemented an end-to-end system enabling solo users to control large swarms of autonomous aircraft in high-stakes, real-world scenarios, and all in real-time. Starting from zero, I did everything from high-level architecture and design of cloud and on-vehicle systems, to UX for video-game-like ease of use & 3D real-time visualization/control, and low-level autopilot code & cloud implementation. This product governs all facets of flight operations of all vehicles concurrently, including take-off, mission execution, telemetry, over-the-air live updates, control system handoffs, and touch-down/landing.

This included:
* 3D real-time visualization/control/telemetry system
* Mission-planning & pattern library experience
* Ground-control software for in-the-field technicians
* Low-level socket control/interface with autopilot systems
* On-vehicle software

### **Holler / Co-Founder, Director  (2019-present)**
I co-founded a social-media company, focused on providing a digital connection to the physical world around us. It's a fundamentally new way to be in community with the people and things in your world: before, during and after experiences. We developed a proprietary 6-dimensional algorithm and user-experience that brings you the communities that matter in your real life, everywhere you go, all throughout the day. Blends aspects of social, messaging, A/R & web 3.0 technologies. Currently in early-access with select areas & communities, general availability coming in late 2023.

This included:
- UX/UI design
- Architecture and implementation of the entire stack, including native iOS/Android apps, web, API, backend, transactional database, data stream, data-lake
- User-testing
- Product launches

### **CJ.com, Tracking and Attribution / Full-stack Engineer lv2  (2018 - 19)**
Worked on the expansion of the core tracking system for CJ Affiliate’s ad-tech, responsible for real-time ingesting and processing of millions of daily consumer interactions in their most critical “always-on” system.
   
#### **A few accomplishments that were particularly challenging:**
- We modernized the core of the affiliate attribution system, a 20+ year old codebase at the
center of the company’s revenue model.
- We managed a world-wide network for processing web-traffic, and correlating web events
across different sites and personas.

### **CJ.com, Analytics and Insights / Full-stack Engineer lv1  (2017 - 18)**
Designed and created a market-leading platform for real-time data analytics, allowing thousands of end-customers to understand what marketing strategies were working and how customers engaged with them.

#### **A few accomplishments that were particularly challenging:**
- We built a brand-new custom analysis suite for large data-sets, and launching it to 20,000+
customers.
- We developed a platform that gives real-time analytics to users using big-data technologies.
